This blog is talking about myself. Who am I? What do I do? What will happend next?

I am a freshman in binary analysis and hacking. I am trying to understand the hacking world. 

The research I am interested in:
```
1. binary analysis
2. vulnerability mining
3. embedded device
4. exploit
5. reverse engineering
6. etc.
```
